            <a href="#">a short oral report about "A simple and quick method to rapidly fabricate physically robust hydrogels"
            <a href="#">Synopsis: Hydrogels—three-dimensional (3D) networks of hydrophilic polymers swelled with water that can maintain their structures based on crosslinking—usually contain more water than polymer material, making them promising for widespread applications, especially as 
biocompatible materials. Despite advances in hydrogel technology in recent years, their application is often severely limited by inadequate mechanical properties and time-consuming fabrication processes. A representative example of such progress is double-network (DN) hydrogels, which have achieved a high toughness performance by incorporating sacrificial bonds to effectively dissipate mechanical energy. Inspired by working principles from a natural composite material—the byssus cuticles of mussels—Here we report a rapid hydrogel preparation strategy that achieves the simultaneous photo-crosslinking and establishment of biomimetic soft–hard material interface microstructures. These biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite hydrogels are prepared within seconds and feature clearly separated phases but have a strongly bonded interface. Due to effective interphase load transfer, biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite gels achieve an ultrahigh toughness and exceptional tensile strength (15.31 MPa) while maintaining structural stability that rivals or surpasses that of commonly used elastomer (non-hydrated) materials. Biomimetic interfacial-bonding nanocomposite gels can be fabricated into arbitrarily complex structures via three-dimensional printing with micrometre-level precision. Overall, this work presents a generalizable preparation strategy for hydrogel materials and acrylic elastomers that will foster potential advances in soft materials.
